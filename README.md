# Quiz & Events App (Django)

This repository contains a simple Django project (`quizapp`) that
provides quizzes and an events list. The project already includes a
virtual environment at `.venv` and a pinned `requirements.txt`.

This README explains how to set up the development environment on
Windows (PowerShell) and how to load sample data so you can try the
site quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Windows with PowerShell
- Python 3.12 installed
- djengo
- (Optional) Git

Note: The project uses a local virtual environment at the workspace
root `.venv`.

## Next steps (suggestions)

- Add a registration page so users can sign up from the frontend.
  authenticated users (requires model changes + migrations).
- Add unit tests for grading logic and view access.
